# 🔥 Gas Consumption Predictor 📈

**TL;DR** ➞ This will become a Python project to predict gas consumption by using historical weather data.

### Most important results: 

Results yet to come 😉

## Why

This is a practice task I set myself. The practical application is very limited, as we all need to heat when it’s cold outside. Nevertheless, I’m doing this **excercise** to get familiar with:

- combining different external **data sources**
- interpolating **missing data**
- comparing **different algorithms** for regression or time-series-predictions
- setting up a **tidy repository**
- creating a **documentation** and **comments** for the reader to fully understand my process 

## What’s new for me

Up to this point I did much python and SQL basics during my data scientist professional certificate course and I want to get my hands dirty! **ARIMA** and **SARIMA** algorithms are a thing that I have *never used before*. 

## How to use

Once I get started I will post the **dependencies** in the root folder for you to be able to run the code. As for now I’m planning to use just regular python libraries and statistical extensions.

## All the Results

Yet to come!

## Feedback

*I’m really looking forward to getting feedback from everybody who reads this.*
